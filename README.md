# Adaptive Switch + Water Gun Project

## Overview
We designed adaptive switches and a switch-adapted electric water gun to enable people with limited mobility to enjoy water play. This project involved 3D printing, simple circuitry, and physical prototyping.

## Devices Built
- **Adaptive Switch**: 3D printed, wired to trigger external devices.
- **Water Gun Adapter**: Modified electric shark water gun with custom stand and external switch jack.

## Design + Fabrication Summary
- Switch designed in [Tinkercad]
- Custom stand printed to stabilize the water gun
- Circuitry added using:
  - 4 mm jack
  - [insert name of button switch]
  - Soldering iron
- **Toy used**: [Electric Water Gun - Shark Water Gun]([https://www.walmart.com/ip/Shark-Stream-Electric-Water-Gun/123456789](https://www.walmart.com/ip/Electric-Water-Gun-Shark-Water-Guns-for-Kids-Adults-32FT-Automatic-Squirt-Guns-High-Capacity-Water-Guns-Summer-Water-Play-Toys/15218453861?classType=REGULAR&from=/search))
